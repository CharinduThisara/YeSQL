YeSQL is an SQL extension that provides more usable, more expressive, and more perfomant Python UDFs and can be integrated into both server based and embedded DBMSs. It enriches SQL with a functional syntax that unifies the expression of relational and user-defined functionality and optimizes the execution of both in a seamless fashion, assigning processing tasks to the DBMS or the UDF host language VM accordingly and employing efficient low-level implementation techniques.
